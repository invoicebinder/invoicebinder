#1. Install msmtp
#The first step is to install the msmtp-mta package.

sudo apt-get install msmtp-mta


# After the install is complete you'll need to set up the defaults file with your Gmail account information. You need to create a file in your home directory called .msmtprc.

nano ~/.msmtprc

Paste the following into the file and edit the portions in bold to reflect your account information.

#Gmail account
defaults
logfile ~/msmtp.log
account gmail
auth on
host smtp.gmail.com
from your_address@gmail.com
auth on
tls on
tls_trust_file /usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/Equifax_Secure_CA.crt
user your_address@gmail.com
password your_gmail_password
port 587
account default : gmail

Save the file and exit the text editor. Since this file contains your account credentials, you'll want to change the permissions to make the file readable only by you.

chmod 600 .msmtprc

#2. Install mailx
#Now that your computer is configured to talk to Gmail, you need a command line email program to handle writing your email. For this I'm going to use mailx from the heirloom-mailx package.

sudo apt-get install heirloom-mailx

Now you need to set up the defaults file so that mailx uses msmtp to send out the email. This file is called .mailrc.

nano ~/.mailrc
Now paste the following into the file and save it.

set sendmail="/usr/bin/msmtp"
set message-sendmail-extra-arguments="-a gmail"

You should now be able to send email from your terminal command line.
Sending email from the command line

Now you can send email from the command line like this:
mail -s "Subject" address@example.com
The cursor will go to a blank line. Enter your email message. When you're done, hit <Enter> to go to a blank line and then hit <Ctrl>+D to end your message. You have just sent your email.
Here you can see that I've sent an email to myself from my Gmail account.
