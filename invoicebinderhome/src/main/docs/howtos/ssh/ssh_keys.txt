#Step 1
Create the RSA Key Pair
The first step is to create the key pair on the client machine (there is a good chance that this will just be your computer):

ssh-keygen -t rsa

Once you have entered the Gen Key command, you will get a few more questions:

#Step 2
Store the Keys and Passphrase
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/demo/.ssh/id_rsa):
You can press enter here, saving the file to the user home (in this case, my example user is called demo).

Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):

#Step 3
Copy the Public Key
ssh-copy-id user@123.45.56.78
ssh-copy-id -i <identityfile> user@123.45.56.78
for example: ssh-copy-id -i id_rsa_jenkins.pub mon2@bmgsoftuat

OR
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@123.45.56.78 "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >>  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"


#Step 4
check if the keys are in the right place. e.g. for use by jenkins the keys should be in /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh

#Step 5
check the keys have the correct permissions and adjust using chmod and chgrp command.+*
